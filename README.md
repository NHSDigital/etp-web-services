## Development

### Requirements
* make
* nodejs + npm/yarn
* [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)
* Java 8+

### Install
```
$ make install
```

#### Updating hooks
You can install some pre-commit hooks to ensure you can't commit invalid spec changes by accident. These are also run
in CI, but it's useful to run them locally too.

```
$ make install-hooks
```

### Environment Variables
Various scripts and commands rely on environment variables being set. These are documented with the commands.

:bulb: Consider using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage your environment variables during development and maintaining your own `.envrc` file - the values of these variables will be specific to you and/or sensitive.

### Make commands
There are `make` commands that alias some of this functionality:
 * `lint` -- Lints the spec and code
 * `publish` -- Outputs the specification as a **single file** into the `build/` directory
 * `serve` -- Serves a preview of the specification in human-readable format

### VS Code Plugins

 * [openapi-lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mermade.openapi-lint) resolves links and validates entire spec with the 'OpenAPI Resolve and Validate' command
 * [OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi) provides sidebar navigation


### Emacs Plugins

 * [**openapi-yaml-mode**](https://github.com/esc-emacs/openapi-yaml-mode) provides syntax highlighting, completion, and path help

### Speccy

> [Speccy](http://speccy.io/) *A handy toolkit for OpenAPI, with a linter to enforce quality rules, documentation rendering, and resolution.*

Speccy does the lifting for the following npm scripts:

 * `test` -- Lints the definition
 * `publish` -- Outputs the specification as a **single file** into the `build/` directory
 * `serve` -- Serves a preview of the specification in human-readable format
